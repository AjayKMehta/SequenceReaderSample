# SequenceReaderSample
Short sample of using SequenceReader for a ReadOnlySequence returned from Pipelines. This sample parses some comma separated items from a Stream of UTF8 bytes. Note: This sample omits some potential performance optimisations for single segment sequences in the interest of demonstrating the use of the SequenceReader.
